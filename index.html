        <h4>Deep learning for microplastic detection in aquatic environment</h4>
        <p>The main objective of this review paper is to examine and summarize current approaches for deep learning-based microplastic detection in aquatic environments. It offers a thorough summary of the methods currently used in the field rather than introducing new datasets or models. The article's objectives are to describe several detection techniques, point out their advantages and disadvantages, and talk about how deep learning is helping to advance microplastic detection technology. It is a tool for comprehending the current situation and directing the course of further research in this field.</p>

        <h2>Startups</h2>
        <p>I'm working on two creative startups right now. The first is Orbisify, a web tool designed to transform networking by assisting people in forming teams and connecting with investors to transform ideas into profitable endeavors. By developing a platform that effectively summarizes YouTube videos and PDF documents, the second startup, which focuses on artificial intelligence, makes knowledge consumption quicker and easier. Both initiatives are ongoing and seek to enhance productivity, creativity, and teamwork in distinctive and significant ways.
